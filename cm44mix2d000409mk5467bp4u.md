Hi I’m new to developing software as intricate as I’m trying to develop. I beekeeper of five years I have five beehives.I have looked around for beekeeping software that I like. I decided I would start my own open source software after seeing the success of jellyfin. The software that I found either is really expensive and I only have five beehives so I don’t really need software like that and I know of a lot of other people that also have the same problem. the issue is that for the features that I would like then I know a lot of other people would like her stuck behind a pay wall so they can’t use the program. I decided to do an open source software so that I can get lots of features and so I can create a program that has helpful features, but doesn’t have all of the non-helpful features that some places might have issue is that only some HML some Java and a lot of python python not really helpful when I’m trying to do and I don’t know how to combine them to be able to work together into one nice HTML program that will save reports onto your computer. This is where you guys come in. I created a repository in GitHub, but I need your help. I don’t know how to do a lot of things so I would like to make this open source for anybody to help me with. Thank you for all of you Who help me. I will leave the GitHub repository link at the end of this article.

PS: I know there’s not a lot there right now, but I will be adding a lot in the next coming days.
